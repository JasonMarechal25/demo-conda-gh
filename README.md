# demo-conda-gh

Demo using [conda-incubator/setup-miniconda](https://github.com/conda-incubator/setup-miniconda) github action to setup Conda environment

## Motivation 

I had issues setting up conda with python 3.10 and installing some requirements (pyinstaller, pip) on production for https://github.com/AntaresSimulatorTeam/antares-xpansion. This repository served as a playgroud and minimal reproductible demo.
